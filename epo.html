      <h3>
        Going into 19th of march we are going into a negitive EPO (eastern
        Pacific oscilation) Starting before the 18th we will start to see colder
        temps EPO is in a negative phase, a ridge in the upper levels of the
        atmosphere is present over the eastern Pacific off the West Coast. This
        ridge is just an area where the air pressure, at a given altitude, is
        higher than in surrounding areas. That ridge of higher pressure air
        blocks the flow of Pacific air from reaching the West Coast. Instead,
        the air flows around the ridge, with a large portion of that redirected
        air flowing up towards Alaska and into the Arctic. As a result, when the
        EPO is negative, Alaska turns warmer than normal. The same ridge that
        turns Alaska warmer also directs more air flow southward out of the
        Arctic into central portions of North America. That in turn allows for
        cold air to build and spread southward out of Canada, resulting in a
        colder than normal pattern for much of Canada and the northern US.
        Negative EPO patterns tend to focus the strongest cold between the
        Rockies and Great Lakes, with the intensity and extent of the cold air
        largely determined by both the strength and longevity of the ridge off
        the West Coast. A stronger and longer lasting ridge will allow for a
        stronger and larger cold air mass to build, resulting in more widespread
        and stronger cold anomalies across the country. A typical negative EPO
        pattern is shown in the image below.
